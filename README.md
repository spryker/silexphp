# Silexphp

The micro framework Silex will no longer be maintained. With this release we introduce a copy of Silex to be able to refactor out Silex and replace it with a Spryker solution. This release will not change any behavior.


## Installation

```
composer require spryker/silexphp
```

The module `spryker/silex` is now requiring `spryker/silexphp` instead of `silex/silexphp` - as refactored version of it. 
You do not need to install this manually. Please consider to update `spryker/silex` instead. 

## Documentation

**WARNING** Silex 1.x is not maintained anymore. This is a copy of `silex/silexphp` we use to refactor out Silex from Spryker.
